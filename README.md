# City Search App


## Introduction
This is my first huge React application. **City Search App** is used to find basic information about USA cities. To see the results check out [Github Pages link](https://kodowicz.github.io/search-app).

## Installation

```
  git clone https://github.com/kodowicz/search-app.git
  cd search-app
  npm install
  npm start
```

## Purposes
- [x] fetch data located in public API
- [ ] show searching results by listing them
- [ ] show details about each city if you are interested
- [ ] delete the list of cities if input is cleared
- [ ] implement good looking animations
